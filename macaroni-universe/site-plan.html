                <h1>Gluten-Free Mozzarella Mac and Cheese</h1>
                <p>12 oz gluten-free macaroni noodles - 340g
                    3 tablespoons unsalted butter - 43g
                    3 tablespoons gluten-free all-purpose flour - 27g
                    1 teaspoon salt
                    1 teaspoon ground mustard
                    1/2 teaspoon onion powder
                    1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
                    2 cups whole milk - 16 fl oz, 480g
                    2 cups mozzarella cheese - shredded (230g)
                    1/2 cup parmesan cheese - shredded (48g)</p>
                <p>Cook the gluten-free elbow macaroni noodles according to the package directions. 
                    I personally like to take 2 minutes off of the cooking time so that my pasta is 
                    al dente. Drain the pasta and set aside.
                    Place a large skillet or saucepan on the stove top over medium heat. Add the 
                    unsalted butter and melt.
                    Once the butter is melted, add the gluten-free all-purpose flour, salt, ground 
                    mustard, onion powder, and black pepper. Whisk until a paste forms, about 1-2 
                    minutes.
                    Pour in the whole milk. Whisk until the mixture has thickened, about 3-5 
                    minutes.
                    Sprinkle in the shredded mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese.
                    Mix until the cheese is completely melted.
                    Add the cooked pasta back into the pan.
                    Fold the pasta into the cheese sauce. Top with fresh basil if desired. Serve 
                    immediately.</p>
                <p><b>Review</b> - This macaroni and cheese is very tasty and is perfect for anyone 
                    who is not able to eat gluten, but still wants to partake in the delicousness of 
                    Macaroni and Cheese. 3/5 stars</p>

                <h1>Instant Pot Mac and Cheese</h1>
                <p>1 pound (454g) elbow macaroni
                    4 cups (1L) cold water
                    4 tablespoons (60g) unsalted butter
                    14 ounces (397g) sharp cheddar , freshly grated
                    6 ounces (170g) mild cheddar or Velveeta cheese , freshly grated
                    Kosher salt and ground black pepper
                    2 large eggs , beaten
                    1 teaspoon ground mustard
                    Optional: 1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce or Frank's hot sauce
                    12 ounces (355ml can) evaporated milk</p>
                <p>Pressure Cook Macaroni: Add 1lb (454g) elbow macaroni, 4 cups (1L) cold water, 
                    and a pinch of kosher salt in Instant Pot.
                    Close the lid, then turn Venting Knob to Sealing Position. Pressure cook at 
                    High Pressure for 4 minutes, then Gradual Quick Release. Carefully open the lid.
                    Amy + Jacky's Tips: There's a slight chance that a tiny amount of foam will 
                    come out with the steam. Have a towel handy.
                    Mix Wet Ingredients: While the macaroni is pressure cooking, mix the wet 
                    ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Beat 2 large eggs, then mix in 1 tsp 
                    ground mustard, 1 tsp Sriracha, and 12 ounces (355ml) evaporated milk. Mix well.
                    Make Mac & Cheese: Use "Keep Warm" function. Give it a quick stir. If there's 
                    more than ¾ cup of water left in the pot, drain some of the liquid.
                    Add 4 tbsp unsalted butter to the pressure cooked macaroni. Mix well with a 
                    silicone spatula and let the butter melt. Pour in the wet ingredients and mix 
                    well.
                    Add grated cheese (⅓ portion at a time), then stir constantly until the cheese 
                    fully melt.
                    Amy + Jacky's Tips: If the mac and cheese is too runny, use "Sauté Less" 
                    function to reduce it down.
                    Serve: Taste and season with kosher salt and ground black pepper. You'll likely 
                    need a couple pinches of kosher salt to brighten the dish.
                    For the best tasting experience, serve immediately! Enjoy~</p>
                <p><b>Review</b> - The most classic examples of Macaroni and Cheese, this splendid 
                    concoction will bring your taste buds onto a holy pilgrimage. 4/5 stars</p>

                <h1>Baked Macaroni and Cheese</h1>
                <p>250g / 8 oz macaroni (elbow pasta)
                    1 tbsp (15g) unsalted butter (or 2 tsp oil)
                    2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs (Note 1)
                    2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter , melted
                    1/4 tsp salt
                    4 tbsp (60g) unsalted butter
                    1/3 cup flour , plain / all purpose
                    3 cups milk , warmed (low or full fat)
                    2 cups freshly shredded cheese, gruyere best (followed by cheddar and Colby)
                    1 cup freshly shredded mozzarella cheese , or more other cheese of choice
                    3/4 tsp salt
                    1 tsp garlic powder
                    1/2 tsp onion powder
                    1/2 tsp mustard powder</p>
                <p>Cook pasta: Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add macaroni and cook per 
                    packet directions MINUS 1 minute.
                    Toss in butter: Drain, return pasta to pot, add butter and toss until melted. 
                    Set aside to cool while making the Sauce (Optional - Note 3).
                    Topping:
                    Mix together Topping. Set aside.
                    Sauce (video is helpful):
                    Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types).
                    Make roux: In a large saucepan or in an ovenproof skillet (I use my 26cm/9" 
                    Lodge cast iron skillet), melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook, 
                    stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
                    Add milk: Add about 1 cup of the milk and mix to dissolve the paste into the 
                    milk. Then add remaining milk and mix until lump free (use whisk if required).
                    Add Seasonings: Mix in salt and Seasonings if using.
                    Thicken sauce: Cook, stirring/whisking regularly, for 5 - 8 minutes until 
                    thickened to a cream consistency. When the Sauce coats the back of a wooden 
                    spoon, you should be able to draw a path with your finger.
                    Add cheese: Remove from stove, add cheese and stir - cheese doesn't need to 
                    melt.
                    Check salt: Adjust salt to taste (if you use recommended cheeses, you won't 
                    need more).
                    Assembling:
                    Assemble: Pour Sauce into pot with Macaroni. Stir quickly, then pour back into 
                    the skillet (I did this) or a baking dish (Note 4). Sprinkle with breadcrumb 
                    topping.
                    Bake for 25 minutes or until top is light golden. Don't bake too long otherwise 
                    you'll bake away the Sauce!
                    Serve: Serve immediately! I sprinkled mine with a bit of fresh parsley. See 
                    notes for best make-ahead method.</p>
                <p><b>Review</b> - Who doesn't love baked macaroni and cheese? This recipe makes 
                    arguably one of the best macaroni and cheese's divine. I love mac and cheese, 
                    but baked mac and cheese really just activates my tastbuds. 5/5 Stars</p>

                <h1>Creamy Baked Macaroni and Cheese</h1>
                <p>1 lb. dried elbow pasta
                    1/2 cup unsalted butter
                    1/2 cup all purpose flour
                    1 1/2 cups whole milk
                    2 1/2 cups half and half 
                    4 cups shredded medium cheddar cheese divided (measured after shredding)
                    2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese divided (measured after shredding)
                    1/2 Tbsp. salt
                    1/2 tsp. black pepper
                    1/4 tsp. paprika smoked paprika is our favorite!</p>
                <p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13").  Set aside.
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  When boiling, add dried pasta 
                    and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente.  Drain and 
                    drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.
                    While water is coming up to a boil, shred cheeses and toss together to mix, 
                    then divide into three piles.  Approximately 3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups 
                    for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.
                    Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat.  Sprinkle in flour and whisk to 
                    combine.  Mixture will look like very wet sand.  Cook for approximately 1 
                    minute, whisking often.  Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so of the half and 
                    half, while whisking constantly, until smooth.  Slowly pour in the remaining 
                    half and half plus the whole milk, while whisking constantly, until combined 
                    and smooth.
                    Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very 
                    thick consistency.  It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out 
                    condensed soup.
                    Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring 
                    to melt and combine.  Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until 
                    completely melted and smooth.
                    In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to 
                    combine fully.  Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish.  
                    Top with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses, then top that with the remaining pasta 
                    mixture.
                    Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, 
                    until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown.</p>

                    and cheese, it is still quite the treat. Your life will be blessed for trying

                    wrong with baked mac and cheese! 3/5 stars</p>
