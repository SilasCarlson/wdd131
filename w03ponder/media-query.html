                <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our 
                    Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; 
                    that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the 
                    whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it 
                    shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless 
                    wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a 
                    foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>

                    purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth 
                    about the salvation of many souls.</p>
